# SQL-Project-2

This is my second project using SQL working with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. The sample tables are from Code Academy. 

I am using the dataset to answer the following questions:

1. How many entries in the **countries** table are from Africa? 

2. What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?

3. What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?

4. What country had the smallest population in 2007? 

5. What is the average population of Poland during the time period dovered by this dataset? 

6. How many countries have the word "The" in their name? 

7. What was the total population of each continent in 2010?
